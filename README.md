# DistanceBetweenCities
Takes the name of two addresses then finds the shortest distance between them from their coordinates.
NB:
  Finding the city name is only there for reference.
  Still having issues getting an accurate value as compared to online values.
  The code for getting the coordinates, converting to city name, and vice versa, was gotten from http://www.javaroots.com/2013/08/convert-location-lat-long-java.html, the author being Abhishek Somani
